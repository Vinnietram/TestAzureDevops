# TestIt

The Purpose of this was to show learn how to create a DevOps project that would utilise the TestId .Net Core ReactJs Web App that sits in Git.  All this was using my own vinnietram@gmail.com for Azure Portal & GitHub

Overview of how I managed to automatically get it deployed:

- I created my TestIt standard Web App
- I then followed the following instructions https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops-project/azure-devops-project-github
  - I choose the existing GIT Hub TestIt Repo
